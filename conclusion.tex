\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:-conc}
Rise of the automated tools designed to accomplish certain tasks and ethical problems stemming thereof is a very potent area for dialogue. It is evident that the set of current solutions have more cons than pros when one put them under scrutiny. We claim that the framework that we proposed in this paper would minimize the short comings and maximize the gains. But one must always remember that until we do obtain a certain level of automation, real the social impact of such a technology can only be speculated. Minute details that escape the most prudent analysis might have very far reaching consequences. And thus we stand on the precipice and stare into the void, and does the void stare back into us?

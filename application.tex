\section{Self-Driving Cars: an Application of our Framework}
\label{sec:-application}

{\large BACKGROUND:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item brief background on self-driving cars
\end{itemize}
{\large APPLICATION:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item three main stakeholders: public, government, corporations
  \item explain that stakeholders can vary depending on culture, 
    value systems, economic status, BUT for the purpose of this 
    application, we’ll focus on generalized American culture, 
    values, and economic status.
  \item try to define American culture
  \item weigh importance of 3 stakeholders in American culture
\end{itemize}


\begin{itemize}
  \item apply our solution (utilitarian, prevent harm/violation of core 
    values with caveat: can’t violate core values of autonomy of self, 
    welfare/well being and economics) to self-driving cars:
  \item 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item what would utilitarian approach look like? Pros/cons
      \item explain what makes our approach different/better than strict utilitarianism
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

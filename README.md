        - [ ] Main Idea: A negative utilitarian framework focused on 
	preventing harm, where we define harm in terms of violation
	of a number of values that we consider to be important.  We
	apply this framework with the caveat that its usefulness may
	break down at certain moral extrema, which result in a
	reluctance to make trade-offs between particular harms in
	particular situations.

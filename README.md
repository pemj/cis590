5. [x] Our Solution (Framework)
    - [x] Identifying Stakeholders : [issue #23](https://github.com/pemj/cis590/issues/23)
        - Basis for Identification:
            - [x] Cultural Bias
            - [x] Value Systems
            - [x] Economic Status
    - [ ] General Stakeholders : [issue #24](https://github.com/pemj/cis590/issues/24)
        -  Public, Government, Corporate and their Different Interplays
    - [x] Value System: All
        - [x] Weighing of the Values:
            - [x] Depending on culture and bias with it
        - [x] Main Idea: A negative utilitarian framework focused on 
	preventing harm, where we define harm in terms of violation
	of a number of values that we consider to be important.  We
	apply this framework with the caveat that its usefulness may
	break down at certain moral extrema, which result in a
	reluctance to make trade-offs between particular harms in
	particular situations.

\begin{abstract}
In the following paper, we carry out an examination of two related 
ethical quandaries concerning the increasing 
degree\cite{frey2013future} of automation in the modern world.  First, 
we consider the ethics of existing systems, exploring the case in 
which automated systems make choices apparently on their own, and what 
kind of moral reasoning we face in such situations.  We consider the 
idea that systems may act as moral agents, or as proxy 
agents\cite{johnson2008computers} for the humans involved in their 
design and deployment.  Secondly, we examine a somewhat more 
fundamental issue: is it right to automate these tasks in the 
first place?  Rather than trying to achieve answers both general and 
correct, we will instead lay out a framework which may be put to use in 
the pursuit of answerss for specific questions.

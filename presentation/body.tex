	\begin{itemize}
	\item Human work that is very labor intensive
	\item repetitive in nature
	\item Largely, not a creative process.

	\begin{itemize}

	\item Improves efficiency

	{\Large Improves quality of life}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item One of the primary pros of automation is the freeing up of time for leisure.
	\item  We have seen a 20 \% reduction in work hours from the start of the 20th century to it's end.
	\item This has left people to pursue more interesting job prospects.

	{\Large Long Answer.}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item According to a study carried out by economists at Deloitte UK LLP, using close to 140 years of census data from Wales and Britain.
	\item Here are some of the results of the study

	{\Large The situation as it stands now}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item We stand at a unique position now, where we are seeing computational power growing rapidly
	\item We are seeing accessibility to services improving.
	\item Manage appointments, remember birthdays, suggest restaurants, suggest best possible routes, plan a vacation
	\item All of the above would require a whole lot of human effort and time to do, today we have apps that do this for us. 
	\item We are slowly seeing a shift from simply menial manual work, but mental work. Some would argue this is a significant paradigm shift.

	{\Large Amazon's Robot Army and the Human- Machine Symbiosis}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item In 2012, Amazon acquired Kiva Systems, that produces the robots that now operate most of amazon's warehouses in the United States
	\item .."Coincidentally or not, Amazon bought Kiva soon after a press report revealed that workers at one of the retailerâ€™s giant warehouses often walked more than 10 miles a day."
	\item Although, this might have led to some jobs being lost. There is still a requirement for human intervention
	\item Packaging, selecting and various other tasks still require a human to do.
	\item And the robot is merely a tool.
	\item ..this is not very different from what happened during the first machine age
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Ethical Automation: will automation create net job loss? }
	{\Large In conclusion..}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item There is still division amongst economists about whether this is similar to the previous industrial age
	\item some believe that with more automation of mental activities, we are going to see a sharp decline in 'good-middle class' jobs
	\item Agreement across the board, that apps taking away knowledge jobs, but it is too early to predict what will happen with certainty.
	\item One thing is for sure, we are definitely in unchartered territory, the only question is whether it will follow trends we have seen earlier or will it set new trends is yet to be seen.
